# Loan-Prediction
It is a classification problem where we have to predict whether a loan would be approved or not. In a classification problem, we have to predict discrete values based on a given set of independent variable(s).

Performed univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, missing values and outlier treatment, k fold cross validation etc. Used different ML algorithms like logistic regression, decision tree, svc, guassian NB, knn etc.
